But now I can use them for so much more."" Sawalich explains that Starkey is ""redefining hearing aids and eliminating the stigma of what hearing aids is.""

Wedbush Securities managing director and senior equity analyst Dan Ives joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination and why he holds steadfast in his bullish view of Tesla. ""I came away, in 25 years covering tech, I think (it was) one of the most eye-popping historical events I've ever attended,” Ives tells Yahoo Finance. He says while there was criticism about the event and concerns that the tech is not as advanced as Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggests, Ives says bears said the same thing about iPhone 16, which the analyst expects to fuel a super cycle for Apple (AAPL). “A lot of analysts, if it's not spoon-fed to you, they're bearish. They don't understand. The point is if I look at Cybercab, the autonomous future where this is all going, I mean, I think this is going to really be the start of a whole new company at Tesla.” He says, “I get the lack of details and why people walk away wanting more, but I look, I just have a different take in terms of my view of where things are heading. And I think the way so many analysts have missed a lot of these stocks, going from $1 trillion to $2 trillion to $3 trillion… is that they can find the technology in their spreadsheets on the tenth floor of their New York City office building.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

""Tesla is the most expensive name in [the] Mag Seven, and it's also seeing significant margin compression. It's facing the threat of EV competition from China and other players like Lucid (LCID) and Rivian (RIVN),"" Ahluwalia tells Yahoo Finance. ""And they've continued to fail to deliver against their roadmap year after year. The stock really hasn't gone anywhere in the past three years. It's a bit of a meme stock now, it's not driven by fundamentals,""  He believes the stock may not see a long-lasting pullback unless Tesla misses delivery targets and faces further margin compression. However, he highlights ""a lot of bad news"" for the stock in the fourth quarter, from seasonality pressures to the presidential election: ""I don't think the risk-reward here is attractive."" Ahluwalia adds that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, by endorsing former President Donald Trump, is now linking Tesla to the fortunes of the Trump campaign, which will have an impact on Tesla stock. ""The primary owners of the stock are retail investors. You don't really see institutions owning Tesla. So it's a big mistake,"" he explains.

Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods joins to share his outlook on the electric vehicle maker's prospects ahead of the results. Woods acknowledges one positive technical indicator for Tesla: the stock has broken from its long-term downtrend that began at its November 2021 high. However, he notes that in 2024, Tesla remains the worst-performing stock among major tech names, leading him to state, ""I don't even consider it one of the Mag 7."" ""It has been trading on hopes and dreams, and now investors want a show-me stock,"" Woods explains, suggesting that companies like Netflix (NFLX) or Eli Lilly (LLY) would be better suited for the Magnificent Seven. Regarding today's upcoming earnings report, Woods characterizes the potential market reaction as a ""coin flip."" ""It's one to watch. Bring your popcorn,"" Woods tells Yahoo Finance while cautioning, ""...I do not have a position in it, nor do I recommend one going into the earnings.""

31-10-2024,Uber is transitioning into a 'software company': Investor,Yahoo,"Uber (UBER) reported third quarter results, beating Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings. The rideshare platform posted revenue of $11.19 billion, surpassing estimates of $10.99 billion. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.20, significantly higher than the anticipated $0.45. Despite these positive metrics, Uber's stock faced pressure due to weaker-than-expected gross bookings and a reduced fourth quarter outlook. Kindred Ventures Founder and managing partner Steve Jang joins Morning Brief to provide insights into Uber's performance and future potential. ""The company is starting to show that it's not just a marketplace company but a software company,"" Jang says, highlighting Uber's profitability and continued growth opportunities. Jang emphasizes Uber's strategic positioning, pointing to potential expansion in autonomous and electric vehicles. He praises the company's cost-consciousness and ability to apply its software network across ridesharing, delivery, and freight services. ""Uber is the demand network,"" Jang states, arguing that emerging technologies like Waymo and Tesla's (TSLA) autonomous vehicles will take time to impact the market. However, Uber's global network, software, and 24/7 operations provide a competitive advantage that these companies may want to use in the future.

31-10-2024,Mag 7 earnings underline the group's huge market influence,Yahoo,"Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) delivered an earnings beat, sending the stock higher and fueling confidence in the “Magnificent Seven” group. With Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) set to report this week, Capital Fund Management head of macro strategy Christian Dery joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the impact of the Magnificent Seven on the broader market. “These companies have gotten so large that on earnings events…you're getting these swings in market cap on the order of $2 [billion] to $400 billion,” Dery says, highlighting Nvidia (NVDA) and its impact on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) specifically. The chipmaker doesn’t report earnings until Nov. 20. As the Magnificent Seven companies report earnings, capital spending will likely be closely watched by investors as Big Tech companies invest billions into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure without a definitive timeline on AI monetization. The strategist says, “The reality is that the existing incumbents have to build out this technology because they can't risk falling behind their competitors,” but “We haven't found the killer use case just yet, and the market is going to start to be more discerning in terms of [the] path to profitability scale. They're going to focus on CapEx and projections for CapEx.” For more on how Dery navigates investing in the Magnificent Seven, watch the video above.

""It will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk,"" Clinton says, adding, ""He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction.

He notes that Tesla could stand to benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a green energy push. Clinton says that Musk will likely ""find some way to try to mend fences and say, 'Look, obviously, it didn't go the way that we were campaigning, but we have this agenda that actually does very much align with some of the principles of the Democratic Party.' I mean, Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world."" As an investor in Musk's companies, Clinton says, ""We try to separate [Musk's companies from his politics]. At Deepwater, we are investors in xAI, and we're big believers that there's basically four companies on Earth that have a chance to build the foundation models that power sort of everything. It's Meta (META) with Llama, it's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) [with] Gemini, OpenAI with GPT, and then xAI with Grok. So that investment is really built, I think, more on just what can they do from a technical perspective.""

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected arguments by lawyers for Tesla investors that the instructions jurors received on the law from the judge presiding over the case before they delivered their verdict in February 2023 were flawed, warranting a new trial.  Lawyers for Tesla shareholders argued the jury instructions were confusing and impermissibly heightened their burden of proof by requiring them to establish Musk knowingly made false statements when he wrote his posts on Twitter, the platform now known as X following Musk's $44 billion acquisition of it in 2022."

""It's interesting because there's a lot of government help or regulation or incentive all pushing the electric vehicle transition, and Tesla's absolutely benefited from that. But we also know that Donald Trump doesn't necessarily support that thinking,"" iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer told Yahoo Finance. Brauer notes that a ""government-led transition to EVs"" is not a concept that Trump has embraced. He points to the broader EV market beyond Tesla, noting that other stocks in the sector are not experiencing the same rally as Tesla. ""It's interesting to see that people feel like Elon's relationship with Donald Trump will overcome a potential shift in policy,"" he adds. Moving forward, Brauer believes that Trump's policy regarding EVs may hurt the sector, including Tesla.

This comes as politicians and observers await the final determination of whether the Democrats or Republicans will gain control of the House of Representatives. Bipartisan Policy Center executive director of economic policy Shai Akabas and The Washington Note founding editor-at-large Steve Clemons provide insights into the potential makeup of Trump's incoming administration on Wealth! Clemons notes that multiple individuals are being considered for key Cabinet positions, including names like Mike Pompeo, Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton, and Josh Hawley. However, Clemons does not foresee Elon Musk being appointed to a formal Cabinet role despite being a major influence throughout Trump's campaign period. ""I think Elon is in a complicated position. For him to get a Senate-confirmed position, I think he'd have to pretty much divest himself from a lot of his assets that define him, like SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA)."" Instead, Clemons believes Musk may be offered an advisory role. One of the initiatives Musk has reportedly advocated for is cutting federal spending by up to $2 trillion. Akabas calls this an ""admirable goal,"" but notes the challenge lies in the fact that much of the government's spending is on ""autopilot"" through programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the national debt. Akabas explains that the potential areas for cuts represent only around 15% of the overall federal budget. ""Even if you eliminated that entire part of the federal spending, which encompasses most government agencies, you would not solve our fiscal challenges that we have today,"" he states.

09-11-2024,Elon Musk will be 'vitally important' in Trump admin: Cathie Wood,Yahoo,"M&A could be back on the menu for companies looking forward to a second Donald Trump presidency — major banks anticipate a slew of beneficial deregulations while Big Tech believes it has found a new friend in its antitrust battles with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). To expand more upon how Corporate America is interpreting Trump's 2024 election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, ARK Investment Management CEO and CIO Cathie Wood sits down with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination Overtime. Wood's firm manages the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which has a variety of holdings in tech players like Tesla (TSLA), Palantir Technologies (PLTR), and Coinbase Global (COIN). Wood calls Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler ""a menace"" to crypto-adoption in the US, and says replacing FTC Chair Lina Khan will ""break the M&A logjam"" for most companies. ""I think venture capital has been harmed dramatically in the last few years, for lack of liquidity events. Liquidity events, very importantly, involve mergers and acquisitions, and those ground to a halt, even in mergers or deals where the two companies were not competing with each other,"" Wood tells Yahoo Finance. A long-time supporter of Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Wood believes he will play a ""vitally important role"" in Trump's government efficiency initiative while remaining ""focused"" on the plethora of companies he owns. ""As he says, and I've always believed, government spending is taxation, and we are bloated right now. We're just overwhelmed with taxation as well,"" Wood explains. ""So I think that he's going to be really important in two ways — introducing new technologies, and actually cutting out a lot of middlemen in the government, just like he did at Twitter."" Tesla currently makes up 14.21% of the ARK Innovation ETF, the holdings worth just over $900 million. Wood is forecasting Tesla stock to reach $2,600 in five years time; while confident in the EV maker's ability to bring safe fully autonomous vehicles to market, she disagrees that Tesla's most recent stock jump has to do with Musk's affiliation with Trump.

09-11-2024,Musk's support of Trump is 'a poker move for the ages': Dan Ives,Yahoo,"Tesla (TSLA) stock is surging after Donald Trump secured his second term as President of the United States. Tesla CEO Elon Musk's involvement in his political campaign has sparked speculation about a potential advisory role in Trump's administration. Wedbush managing director and senior equity research analyst Dan Ives joins Asking for a Trend to discuss potential impacts on Tesla and the broader tech sector. ""It's a new era with Trump because ultimately, if you look now, autonomous is going to get fast-tracked in our opinion, and that is significant because of Tesla and the AI future,"" he tells Yahoo Finance, describing Musk's strategic backing of Trump a ""poker move for the ages."" Ives outlines three key potential impacts that could benefit: changes to EV tax credits could give Tesla advantages in price, scale, and scope, the Cybercab project ""could get accelerated by years,"" and current regulatory issues ""essentially now go away."" ""Musk is going to be a whisper in the White House, and that is something the market is factoring in,"" Ives states, describing it as ""a Goldilocks scenario for any tech investor.""

""It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,"" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of ""hold[ing] a grudge"" or being ""very vindictive."" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they ""stand to gain"" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains ""so uncertain"" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.

18-11-2024,Is there a future for EV tax credits in a second Trump term?,Yahoo,"With President-elect Donald Trump taking office for his second term, a major conversation circulating this week is whether or not the commander in chief will end tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs). Will his relationship with Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk help influence his decision over these tax credits? Will the two clash over their environmental ideologies? We get into it. In this week’s episode of Capitol Gains, anchor Rachelle Akuffo, Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul, and senior columnist Rick Newman break down everything you need to know about the history of these EV credits and whether or not they could still have a future under the Trump administration. Werschkul says it’s ""a real interesting question"" and the Trump/Musk relationship could factor into the future of these credits. “I think there is a real case to be made that Tesla (TSLA) is fine with a fossil fuel-focused agenda including a rollback of some of the green energy credits,” Werschkul says. “Tesla is an established EV company. If the startups around him get their government funding cut off they’re in a lot of trouble. Tesla is fine. Tesla’s a company. Tesla’s not going anywhere.” Newman breaks down the history of the EV tax credits and how they started during the Obama administration. “There’s a large degree of irony here,” Newman says. “Those consumer credits really persuaded a lot of early adopters to buy a Tesla. And I think there’s a lot of people early on who bought a Tesla who would not have bought it, if not for the tax credit. So that helped Tesla become the leading electric vehicle company, and now [Tesla doesn’t] need it.” To learn more, listen to the full episode of Capitol Gains here.

Roberts highlighted affordability as the primary trend in the auto industry throughout 2024. For consumers, he explains, ""It really came down to high vehicle prices and interest rates at multi-decade highs, really kind of increas[ing] those multi-payments for consumers, and that led to kind of trickle-down effects for the greater industry."" Regarding the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on the US auto industry, Roberts notes that ""much is uncertain right now."" He emphasizes that the fallout would highly depend on when the tariffs go into effect and which countries are impacted. ""I think if there's forewarning, the auto industry is very adaptable and can move around and kind of reallocate resources,"" Roberts says. ""But if it goes into immediate effect, that's where it would be a little bit more disruptive for the industry."" Regarding the incoming Trump administration's considerations to remove EV tax credits, he notes that they currently help support affordability for both new and used electric vehicles, and if removed, it could represent ""a headwind for the industry in 2025.""

While the narrow leadership has raised some concerns about concentration and broadening trading themes, Baird Investment strategist Ross Mayfield tells Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Morning Brief that these worries may be overblown. ""It's certainly something we keep an eye on, but I would say that if you had been worried about that concentration or used it as a reason to get out of the market at any point over the last couple of years, it would have been a mistake,"" Mayfield says. The strategist believes investors ""should be celebrating that some of the biggest and most innovative companies are in our markets. Concentration risk, or heavy concentration, has not been a good forward indicator over the last 40 or 50 years based on the data that we've seen."" ""It's something to keep an eye on [as] it maybe makes the market a little bit more fragile to something like Nvidia having a bad stretch run, but it's not something that we worry about too much,"" Mayfield adds.

Fish emphasizes that ""retailers and manufacturers need to make a decision about how much they're going to focus on China,"" citing weakening consumer demand and ongoing US-China tensions as key factors. Regarding Tesla's position in China, Fish observes that ""Tesla's future in China is so tied to Trump's relationship with Musk"" and how long that lasts.

Dorsheimer observes ""investor fatigue"" surrounding Tesla's latest offerings, including the Cybertruck and Models S and X. He notes that, while the Cybertruck's price is set to decrease, it remains ""a very niche market"" for that vehicle type, suggesting a limited impact on overall deliveries. He emphasizes that Tesla's success primarily stems from its more affordable offerings: the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. ""For Tesla to rebound from a volume perspective on the auto side of its business, we think it's really going to be the introduction of a Model 2 or hatchback,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.  Dorsheimer highlights ""a silver lining"" in Tesla's energy storage side and concludes, ""Tesla has a lot of different tools in its toolbox, and we'll see how it plays out.

07-01-2025,Tesla's stock valuation appears 'discounted': Analyst explains,Yahoo,"President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariff policy has raised investor concerns about its potential impact on industries, including electric vehicles (EVs), particularly for companies like Tesla (TSLA). Stifel NextGen transport analyst Stephen Gengaro joins Market Domination to share his perspective on the EV maker amid tariff uncertainties. Gengaro suggests that Trump's proposed tariff policy would have ""wide-ranging"" effects, including reduced competition in US markets — a development that could be ""theoretically a positive"" for Tesla. However, he cautions that the company may face challenges with its international supply chain for parts sourced outside the US. The analyst emphasizes that Tesla is ""more than a car company,"" pointing to initiatives like full self-driving (FSD) technology as ""a huge value driver"" for the stock in the ""medium-to-long term."" He suggests that the potential of these ventures makes the current stock valuation appear ""discounted."" Looking ahead to the Trump administration, Gengaro anticipates more favorable regulations that could accelerate Tesla's initiatives. ""As far as Musk betting on Trump, I think he's clearly engaged in the conversation as far as getting regulation accelerated on the FSD side,"" he explains. ""And that sort of opens the door for just various growth opportunities for the company over time.""

Tigay notes that Tesla is a leader in the world of electric vehicles (EVs) and is likely to receive favorable treatment from the new presidential administration. This may be bolstered by the fact that reduced EV spending overall is anticipated under Trump 2.0, positioning Tesla to be the winner of the sector. Beyond Tesla's EVs, Tigay highlights the company's battery sector as a promising revenue stream in the future. ""I think that's going to be a big player going forward in the next four years,"" he says. , among other signs that Bezos has been fostering an amicable relationship with the president-elect. These moves note a shift from the historical feud between Bezos and Trump.Amazon is another one of Tigay's top picks, partly due to Jeff Bezos' recent financial support of Trumphttps://finance.yahoo.com... ""It seems like Amazon, this time around, is attempting to be on more favorable conditions,"" Tigay explains. ""In general, Amazon wants to have a favorable relationship with this administration because there's big money to be had, specifically in the cloud services."" He adds that Amazon may be better positioned for upcoming tariffs and expected tax reductions. Tigay's third top pick is Palantir, which he describes as ""the software innovation of the AI world.""

VanCronkhite advises investors to be strategic. ""That doesn't mean sell it; it doesn't mean leave. Just be careful about staying too long. Rotate down,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.

The Magnificent 7 stocks are performing strongly again, even with chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report not due until May 28. This leadership group, which had largely underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, has seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, tech mega-caps like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL (GOOGL)) significantly exceeded earnings estimates. Barclays' data indicates that these large-cap tech companies beat analyst earnings estimates by an average of 8% in the first quarter. Second, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was once again impressive. Goldman Sachs' (GS) data reveals that large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieved an average earnings growth of 28% in the first quarter, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500.

The Austin robotaxi launch, which Musk says will ""tentatively"" open to the public on June 22, comes as Tesla tries to arrest a global vehicle-sales slide, stemming from both its aging lineup of human-driven electric vehicles and Musk's right-wing political activities."

24-07-2025,Tesla faces 'a few rough quarters' from end of US EV support: Musk,Yahoo,"STORY: Tesla's in for a ""few rough quarters"", says its CEO Elon Musk, citing U.S. government cuts in support for electric vehicle makers.That's as Tesla posted its worst quarterly sales decline in over a decade Wednesday.Overall revenue fell 12%, despite the launch of a refreshed version of Tesla's best-selling Model Y SUV - which investors had hoped would boost sales.Revenue and profit were also hurt by a 51% dive in sales of regulatory credits.Those credits are bought from Tesla by other automakers who have difficulty complying with government emissions rules.The U.S. government later this year is cutting tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV buyers.:: FileWhen asked on a quarterly results conference call about the credits, Musk predicted ""a few rough quarters"" before a wave of revenue from self-driving software and services begins late next year.Tesla shares fell nearly 5% after his comments.In the meantime, Tesla says it is working on a new, cheaper car - with a few initial units made by the end of June.But production would ramp up next quarter, slower than initially expected.The company also said it continued to expect volume production of its custom-built robotaxi - called the Cybercab - and Semi Truck in 2026.Much of the company's trillion-dollar valuation hangs on its bet on humanoid robots and on its robotaxi service.But one analyst - CEO of Systematic Ventures Max Wolff - was skeptical of its chances to turn fortunes.""The problem is there's other guys who have done more rides with less issues in a Robotaxi, particularly Waymo. This is sort of a major competitor here who's been at this longer, done many more rides and seems to have had a smoother integration. For the robotaxi business to rescue Tesla, as some had hoped, it would have had to have gotten a lot further, a lot faster than it has."""

So meaning 25 basis points in September, October, and December. So those three factors together I think have caused investors not only to cover whatever shorts there might have been, but also add new money.”Shares of Tesla also boosted markets with a six percent gain.As did Micron Technology shares, which jumped seven and a half percent after Citigroup raised its price target on the memory chipmaker's stock.And shares of Warner Brothers Discovery leapt 29% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount Skydance is preparing a majority cash bid for the struggling media company."

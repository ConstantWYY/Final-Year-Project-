US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm joins Market Domination to discuss this energy transition and its implications. Granholm explains that AI data centers are still in their building phase, and it's ""not going to happen overnight."" She notes an increase in ""hyperscalers"" entering power purchase agreements with utility companies to ""get them across the finish line."" The Energy Department, she adds, is focused on ensuring these data centers are powered by clean energy as the transition progresses. Highlighting the potential of SMRs, Granholm explains, ""Those are able to... be virtually connected to a data center to be able to power that center with clean baseload power, not intermittent power,"" adding she is ""excited about this movement."" However, she acknowledges the challenge of widespread SMR adoption, noting that tech companies need an ""nth of a kind experience,"" explaining, ""nobody wants to be the one to buy the first one."" ""If all of these tech companies kind of band together and not ask for different designs, different specifications, but if they can agree on basic power, then you can order a six pack or a 12 pack of these small modular reactors and be able to power your data centers,"" Granholm states, noting rising interest from Big Tech in these reactors to be able to ""bring their own power with them.""

24-10-2024,What do Tesla and IBM earnings signal about Big Tech next week?,Yahoo,"IBM (IBM) shares are under pressure after releasing mixed third quarter results showing artificial intelligence (AI) and software growth with weakness in other areas. Tesla (TSLA) stock is on the rise after the electric vehicle (EV) maker kicked off “Magnificent Seven” earnings. With Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) earnings on deck, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss whether IBM or Tesla earnings are a better indicator of what investors should expect of Big Tech earnings. Morgan explains that IBM’s earnings were mixed but ultimately supported the AI story, “The IBM number wasn't bad. They obviously missed on revenues. But I think the expectations coming into that third quarter report were extremely elevated … It's really kind of a mixed report because they did say they generated about $3 billion in revenues directly from generative AI, and of course, everyone's really focused on that.” While IBM’s mixed results send the stock lower, Tesla, which also reported mixed results, soars. Morgan says he thinks of Tesla as being “kind of clumped into” the Magnificent Seven group. “Personally, I don't see how Tesla fits into that group. To me, they're an automaker, but they seem to be rolled into the tech group.” He notes that the positive reaction to Tesla’s earnings adds to the “good momentum” that comes into Big Tech's earnings. Big Tech earnings offer insights into how companies are spending on tech and their macro-level outlook. Morgan says that macroeconomic conditions continue to affect Big Tech spending as companies cut tech spending during heightened recession fears. He adds that the IBM report did have “some indication” of a slowdown of tech spending, with the IBM CEO saying, “One of the reasons why they fell up short in their consulting segment was the fact that CIOs are using money that would have been designated for consulting, and they're moving that into AI. They're not populating both. So we are seeing little bits of evidence that we may see some slowdown.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

24-10-2024,The one factor that could make or break Mag 7 market leadership,Yahoo,"Tesla (TSLA) has kicked off ""Magnificent Seven"" earnings, posting beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins. Ayako Yoshioka, Wealth Enhancement Group senior portfolio manager, joins Morning Brief to discuss what these results mean for the rest of the Magnificent Seven earnings and overall market leadership heading into 2025. Yoshioka explains that there is a greater emphasis on tech sector earnings given its concentration in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and weight within the Magnificent Seven. However, she notes that CapEx (capital expenditures) spending among hyperscalers will determine their leadership position moving forward. She tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think they're going to evaluate it at some point and see whether or not they need to continue at the pace that they've been at over the last few quarters."" With AI still being early in its development, Yoshioka argues that it's ""going to be a while"" before seeing real competition among hyperscalers and chip companies.

OptionsPlay senior options strategist Brian Overby tells Yahoo Finance that trading options around earnings is ""always going to be speculative in nature."" He says one of the biggest things traders will want to establish is ""what the expected move is after that earnings report. And the marketplace will tell you that just by looking at the nearest term option contract."" Overby explains how he would position for Amazon (AMZN) ahead of its results on Oct. 31. ""Amazon is looking for an expected move of around 6.5%, which is really about 12 points. So if I'm setting up a trade where I want to be bullish or bearish, because you got to realize it has nothing to do with if the market's going to go up or down, it's just saying that after the earnings report, the marketplace is looking for a move of about that nature. So you want to fit that into your forecast. So Amazon, they're going to be announcing on Thursday. The Friday option contracts got one one day to live. And I'm looking at doing a long call spread going into that earnings date. And I want to make sure that the strike that I'm selling in that position is going to be within that expected move. And that's how you should always approach these speculative trades around earnings.""

Next week, five of the “Magnificent Seven” names — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL) — are reporting quarterly earnings. “That's obviously a huge deal, not just for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and related indexes, but also for the S&P 500 (^GSPC),” the strategist says, noting that the results could feed the “debate back and forth between, are we going to get a more cyclical kind of rebound because the economy is stronger or more of that kind of defensive growth trade that we've seen really over the last 18 months.” On top of continued third quarter earnings results, the market will also get new data that could provide insight into the state of the US economy and the Federal Reserve’s next move at the November meeting. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday with fresh non-farm payroll data on Friday, November 1. Investors will also get the first cut of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the third quarter of 2024 on Wednesday. Amid uncertainties, Hill says he does expect markets to go higher. “There's a lot of reasons to worry,” like rates staying higher for longer and the election, among other factors, but “really when we cut through a lot of that noise, we focus on the primarily on the health of the underlying economy, because that's going to drive earnings and ultimately that's going to dictate the path for risk assets. We still see that, broadly speaking, as being something that's that's very supportive.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

01-11-2024,Why Amazon must 'keep spending' on AI,Yahoo,"Amazon (AMZN) topped third quarter earnings estimates on both revenue and profit. One key metric investors were closely watching is the company's capital expenditures, particularly those related to AI investments. Citizens JMP Equity Research Analyst Nick Jones breaks down the significance of Amazon's massive tech spending on Morning Brief. Jones emphasizes that Amazon's AI investments are critical to maintaining its competitive edge. ""AI is this massive, massive opportunity. We're only a year or so into the opportunity, so we're probably looking at a very long runway of spend,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. The company plans to invest $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2024, and in 2025 ""they'll likely spend more."" Despite these substantial investments, Jones notes Amazon maintains strong operating income margins, which he sees as a key stock performance indicator. ""Amazon's a dominant cloud player. They're going to want to be dominant in AI. They need to keep spending,"" Jones adds, highlighting what he sees as a ""multi-decade runway"" for the company's artificial intelligence strategy.

The analyst explains that while all the cloud hyperscalers are ramping up their capital spending to invest in AI, investors seem less concerned about Amazon’s AI spending compared to Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT).

So they may not be seeing the same type of capacity constraint issues that Microsoft is seeing at the moment.” Sundaram notes, “The other thing I would point out too is, you know, Amazon has multiple levers to grow margins,” including their e-commerce business, advertising, Amazon Web Services, and other segments.

Despite the strong showings, capital expenditures (CapEx) on artificial intelligence (AI) are spooking some investors. Bernstein internet equity research analyst Mark Shmulik tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon ""feels like kind of the name that you can put money to work in and get excited about."" Alphabet also reported a positive third quarter, but Shmulik notes ongoing legal issues — especially in the antitrust arena — for Google that could hold the company back: ""There's just a whole bunch of noise around the name that's really hard to break through."" In terms of Meta, Shmulik also thinks the socail media giant is positioned well, but that when it comes to AI spending, ""we're still waiting to see just how big that spending is going to be and over what duration we could expect the return."" Shmulik goes on to explain his Underpeform rating on Reddit (RDDT). Watch the video above to hear Shmulik's take on big tech and other internet stocks.

05-11-2024,Constellation Energy's dip is buying opportunity into nuclear: Analyst,Yahoo,"Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) have fallen as much as 12% today in tandem with other nuclear energy names, after government regulators blocked Amazon's (AMZN) power agreement with provider Talen Energy (TLN). CFRA Equity Analyst Daniel Rich joined Catalysts to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear energy future as companies search for clean methods to power their AI data centers. ""It certainly is a setback,"" Rich tells Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills, but it's far from over. The CFRA analyst notes that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision was split, and it ""wouldn't be surprising"" for there to be a rehearing shortly.  Though the regulatory roadblock adds a bit of near-term uncertainty, Rich is still ""pretty favorable"" on Constellation Energy and its peers given the interest from Big Tech — Amazon, Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power. ""Whatever happens with the [FERC] decision, we think Constellation is in a pretty good spot,"" Rich says, adding that today's sell-off in shares presents a viable buying opportunity for investors. The regulatory news overshadowed Constellation Energy's robust third quarter results out Monday morning. The energy giant raised its full year adjusted operating earnings guidance after topping Wall Street's expectations for operating revenue by more than $1 billion. In the earnings release, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez lays out ""the importance of AI and the data economy to America’s economic competitiveness and national security can’t be overstated."" CFRA maintains its Buy opinion on Constellation shares, but lowered the 12-month price target by $25 to $280 per share citing the uncertainty from the FERC decision. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). For more coverage on Big Tech's adoption of nuclear energy, catch Yahoo Finance's interviews with X-energy CEO Clay Sell about Amazon's investment into the nuclear reactor designer, Kairos Power Co-Founder and CEO Mike Laufer's input on the nuclear startup's partnership with Google, and Oklo (OKLO) Co-Founder and CEO Jake DeWitte who explains the business model for nuclear energy providers.

BMO Wealth Management CIO Yung-Yu Ma joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to check in on the top stories moving the market, including third quarter earnings, the US election, and the Federal Reserve meeting. ""The reaction is really keying off of is just the very high amount of spending that's going into AI and the very uncertain payoffs and far-out potential payoffs that would be coming from those from the mega-cap tech companies that have such a large weighting in the index ... It makes sense that the market isn't going to get enthusiastic about that,"" Ma tells the Morning Brief team. He notes, ""We do think 2025 is going to be a healthy year for earnings growth. We actually think that what's going to drive earnings growth in 2025 is business spending broadly. And part of that is certainly AI and what goes into it [like] data centers, upgrades to the electricity grid, other infrastructure that will drive spending, technology spending.""

The decision comes as Big Tech companies have turned to nuclear energy to power their artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, stoking some worries about the recent rally in nuclear energy stocks. ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. ""Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers. But the order may not represent a long-term risk. It's more that FERC may have punted or didn't want to set a precedent about co-location."" Fox outlines, ""Regulators are concerned about three things. They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy. Does the influx of new data centers create a concern about being able to meet state or local decarbonization policies?""

The controversial plan mandating workers come to Amazon offices every day starting next year, up from three days now, has caused consternation among employees who say it is stricter than other tech companies and will hinder efficiency because of commuting times.  ""A number of people I've seen theorized that the reason we were doing this is, it's a backdoor layoff, or we made some sort of deal with city or cities,"" said Jassy, according to a transcript of the meeting reviewed by Reuters."

Mahoney tells retail investors, ""Don't get involved in this. You know there's a lot of emotion, and I know it's easy for me to say that, but the last thing you want to do is get whipsawed out of your position ... Our Founding Fathers kind of figured this out, that we have a balance of power and after this election, we're still going to have a balance of power."" He adds there are ""so many tailwinds,"" including the Federal Reserve meeting on Thursday, Big Tech companies' artificial intelligence (AI) spending, and strong earnings. ""You have a lot of bears [that have] been on the sidelines. They're going to have to commit capital toward the end of the year. Otherwise, the index is going to be way ahead of them. So again, I just say that sometimes we lose sight. We have to come back [and] see where we are, and there's a really strong tailwind despite who wins."" He highlights, ""Our favorites are still the market leaders"" like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). ""That's the way we've been playing this right now is some of your best stocks you like with the added volatility. Make volatility your friend, not your foe.

""It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,"" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of ""hold[ing] a grudge"" or being ""very vindictive."" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they ""stand to gain"" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains ""so uncertain"" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.

Mager says Precision Neuroscience's technology is high-bandwidth, sits on ""the surface of the brain without doing any damage,"" and is reversible.  In an interview with Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Yasmin Khorram from the Yahoo Invest conference, Mager discusses the company's road ahead and potential market, what to expect from the upcoming Trump presidency, and a possible IPO. “We view brain computer interfaces as a generationally important life sciences innovation,” says Mager. “This is gonna have applicability today in paralysis, tomorrow in a number of different areas.” To see every interview from Yahoo Finance Invest, click here.

The Census Bureau data shows retail sales rose 0.4% in October. That was higher than the 0.3% economists were expecting, according to Bloomberg. September's headline number was also revised upwards.  LSEG Director of Consumer Research Jharonne Martis says the data point that stood out to her was the year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales. She notes that the October data benefits from Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Deal Days but adds that other retailers piggyback off that promotion and offer their own deals. ""It's telling us the consumer is still gravitating toward those online deals,"" she says. When it comes to the e-commerce business, Martis thinks Walmart (WMT) is starting to give Amazon some more competition. Why? ""They're giving the consumer the ability to shop the way they want to, whether it be ordering it on your mobile... and picking it up at the store on your way home or just having it delivered right there from the store to your house. Walmart is definitely giving Amazon a lot of competition,"" she tells Yahoo Finance.

Discovery (WBD) and the NBA reaching a lawsuit settlement over sports broadcast rights, FanDuel parent Flutter Entertainment's (FLUT) strong earnings results, and the Formula 1 Grand Prix returning to Las Vegas. This week on Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano breaks down these top sports headlines. ""Warner Bros. Discovery sued the NBA after losing out on their media rights package earlier this year... Warner Bros. is going to be getting a few additional assets, and the NBA is going to be moving on with its new partner Amazon (AMZN),"" Pompliano explains. ""This is sort of a win-win for everyone because the NBA gets to move on with Amazon. ESPN gets Inside the NBA from Warner Bros. who's going to be licensing them the wildly successful show and Warner Brothers is now going to get to sub-license some college football and college basketball games from ESPN. Again, a win for everyone involved."" FanDuel parent company Flutter Entertainment saw 27% revenue growth year-over-year in the third quarter. Pompliano puts the sports bettor's $114 million net loss and total revenue of $3.25 billion into context, as platforms like FanDuel and DraftKings move closer to profitability as more states adopt sports betting. The Formula 1 Grand Prix is returning to Las Vegas after pulling off a successful race in 2023. The Las Vegas Grand Prix 2024 will take place from November 21 to 23. The Formula 1 Grand Prix ""was a huge event last year,"" Pompliano explains, ""Liberty Media invested more than $500 million into a permanent paddock building that's 300,000 square feet right off the Las Vegas strip. They had a ton of people attend the event, and it reportedly brought in a $1.5 billion economic impact with visitors alone spending $864 million.""

""The second part of it is that generative AI requires a meaningful amount of power for these racks and for these chips, and we've been innovating on our power delivery design to these servers as well.""

""Finally, our improvements in mechanical and electrical efficiency, to the tune of about 40% to 46% or so, has actually improved the amount of capacity we can deliver for our customers in the exact same data center."" Ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) official launch of its new AI chip, Blackwell, Kalyanaraman talks about AWS' ongoing partnership with Nvidia and how the latest chip fits into the company's AI push.

""The 65-plus population surge, the silver tsunami, is really significant. So by 2050, you are going to have nearly a quarter of the population that is 65 or older. That's up from 18% right now,"" Thomas says, explaining, ""There are huge implications, in big ways and then in everyday ways."" Thomas goes on to say that ""at a macro level, you have to think about things like home renovation because nearly 75% of the people that we've spoken to in that cohort do plan to or hope to age in [their] home, and so there's a huge amount of home renovation that's going on as they modify their homes to make way for aging in place... And when you think that that's a $1 trillion market in North American home renovation, we think that under some scenarios, that could continue to grow another 5% or 6%."" ""On the everyday side of the spectrum, one thing that came out of our work is coffee. So it turns out when you get older, you drink more coffee,"" Thomas explains, connecting this experience with the reason why coffee chain Dutch Bros. (BROS) is among TD Cowen's ""best ideas for 2025.

D-Wave (QBTS), a quantum computing company, announced it secured $175 million in funding. CEO Alan Baratz joins Catalysts Co-Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to break down what's going on in the quantum computing space and what investors need to know about its connection to artificial intelligence (AI). ""There's a lot of synergy between AI and quantum,"" Baratz says, adding, ""The way I think about it is that there are three areas in which AI and quantum work together."" ""The first and most obvious is that each can work side by side to solve a problem synergistically. For example, you might use AI to predict product demand in the future and then use quantum computing to optimize the supply chain to meet that demand."" ""Second, we are doing a fair amount of work right now on how quantum computing could be used as part of the model training and inference for AI."" The CEO explains, ""Because of the fact that [quantum is] so much faster than classical [computing] and requires so much less power, we think that we may be able to support model training and inference with much lower power consumption than what's happening today, which could be a game-changer."" ""Finally, models on quantum distributions rather than classical distributions may allow for more accurate [AI] models.""

""It's certainly something we keep an eye on, but I would say that if you had been worried about that concentration or used it as a reason to get out of the market at any point over the last couple of years, it would have been a mistake,"" Mayfield says. The strategist believes investors ""should be celebrating that some of the biggest and most innovative companies are in our markets. Concentration risk, or heavy concentration, has not been a good forward indicator over the last 40 or 50 years based on the data that we've seen."" ""It's something to keep an eye on [as] it maybe makes the market a little bit more fragile to something like Nvidia having a bad stretch run, but it's not something that we worry about too much,"" Mayfield adds.

However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

While acknowledging their ""tremendous"" returns, he cautions, ""That's a risk because the market is broadening out right now.""

VanCronkhite advises investors to be strategic. ""That doesn't mean sell it; it doesn't mean leave. Just be careful about staying too long. Rotate down,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.

The Magnificent 7 stocks are performing strongly again, even with chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report not due until May 28. This leadership group, which had largely underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, has seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, tech mega-caps like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL (GOOGL)) significantly exceeded earnings estimates. Barclays' data indicates that these large-cap tech companies beat analyst earnings estimates by an average of 8% in the first quarter. Second, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was once again impressive. Goldman Sachs' (GS) data reveals that large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieved an average earnings growth of 28% in the first quarter, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500.

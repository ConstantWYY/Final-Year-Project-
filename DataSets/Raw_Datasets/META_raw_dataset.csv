""I think we're still in the early innings for Nvidia. Nvidia clearly is capturing the bulk of the value capture in the sector and industry,"" Ahluwalia tells Yahoo Finance. He expects Nvidia stock to hit $150 by the end of 2024, especially as hyperscalers intend to spend between $50-$100 billion on GPU compute. Ahluwalia believes ""there's no question"" about Nvidia being the first company to reach a $4 trillion valuation. He argues, ""We made a call earlier this year that Nvidia would be the most valuable company in the world. It achieved that milestone yesterday, and the demand for GPU chips is strong. And you're seeing enterprises start to get some ROI (return on investment) on it from the early adopters — Meta's (META) seen ROI on their CapEx (capital expenditures) spend. So, we think Nvidia's got plenty of room to grow from here."" Of the ""Magnificent Seven"" players, he sees Nvidia as the AI winner alongside Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta.

The strategist agrees that the market may be overvalued, and investors could benefit from a pullback. ""Is the market stretched? Sure, it's stretched. Should it pull back? Of course, it should. Actually, as a chief market strategist and a wealth manager, I want to see the market pull back because I can't put money to work,"" Polcari says. ""I don't want to chase stretched names and stretched sectors. I'm actually waiting for the market to pull back,"" he says, adding, ""I do suspect that we will see a pullback, and I welcome it."" Looking at the Magnificent Seven specifically, Polcari says ""AI is going to absolutely continue to crush it."" He nods to a report from Dan Ives ""talking about now the second derivative of AI."" The strategist says the artificial intelligence trade will move beyond the Magnificent Seven to other names like Cisco (CSCO), SAP (SAP), IBM (IBM), and Oracle (ORCL). ""Tech is the place to be. I don't say you should chase it up here, let it pull back, and then jump in."" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

24-10-2024,What do Tesla and IBM earnings signal about Big Tech next week?,Yahoo,"IBM (IBM) shares are under pressure after releasing mixed third quarter results showing artificial intelligence (AI) and software growth with weakness in other areas. Tesla (TSLA) stock is on the rise after the electric vehicle (EV) maker kicked off “Magnificent Seven” earnings. With Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) earnings on deck, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss whether IBM or Tesla earnings are a better indicator of what investors should expect of Big Tech earnings. Morgan explains that IBM’s earnings were mixed but ultimately supported the AI story, “The IBM number wasn't bad. They obviously missed on revenues. But I think the expectations coming into that third quarter report were extremely elevated … It's really kind of a mixed report because they did say they generated about $3 billion in revenues directly from generative AI, and of course, everyone's really focused on that.” While IBM’s mixed results send the stock lower, Tesla, which also reported mixed results, soars. Morgan says he thinks of Tesla as being “kind of clumped into” the Magnificent Seven group. “Personally, I don't see how Tesla fits into that group. To me, they're an automaker, but they seem to be rolled into the tech group.” He notes that the positive reaction to Tesla’s earnings adds to the “good momentum” that comes into Big Tech's earnings. Big Tech earnings offer insights into how companies are spending on tech and their macro-level outlook. Morgan says that macroeconomic conditions continue to affect Big Tech spending as companies cut tech spending during heightened recession fears. He adds that the IBM report did have “some indication” of a slowdown of tech spending, with the IBM CEO saying, “One of the reasons why they fell up short in their consulting segment was the fact that CIOs are using money that would have been designated for consulting, and they're moving that into AI. They're not populating both. So we are seeing little bits of evidence that we may see some slowdown.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

24-10-2024,The one factor that could make or break Mag 7 market leadership,Yahoo,"Tesla (TSLA) has kicked off ""Magnificent Seven"" earnings, posting beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins. Ayako Yoshioka, Wealth Enhancement Group senior portfolio manager, joins Morning Brief to discuss what these results mean for the rest of the Magnificent Seven earnings and overall market leadership heading into 2025. Yoshioka explains that there is a greater emphasis on tech sector earnings given its concentration in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and weight within the Magnificent Seven. However, she notes that CapEx (capital expenditures) spending among hyperscalers will determine their leadership position moving forward. She tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think they're going to evaluate it at some point and see whether or not they need to continue at the pace that they've been at over the last few quarters."" With AI still being early in its development, Yoshioka argues that it's ""going to be a while"" before seeing real competition among hyperscalers and chip companies.

Next week, five of the “Magnificent Seven” names — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL) — are reporting quarterly earnings. “That's obviously a huge deal, not just for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and related indexes, but also for the S&P 500 (^GSPC),” the strategist says, noting that the results could feed the “debate back and forth between, are we going to get a more cyclical kind of rebound because the economy is stronger or more of that kind of defensive growth trade that we've seen really over the last 18 months.” On top of continued third quarter earnings results, the market will also get new data that could provide insight into the state of the US economy and the Federal Reserve’s next move at the November meeting. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday with fresh non-farm payroll data on Friday, November 1. Investors will also get the first cut of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the third quarter of 2024 on Wednesday. Amid uncertainties, Hill says he does expect markets to go higher. “There's a lot of reasons to worry,” like rates staying higher for longer and the election, among other factors, but “really when we cut through a lot of that noise, we focus on the primarily on the health of the underlying economy, because that's going to drive earnings and ultimately that's going to dictate the path for risk assets. We still see that, broadly speaking, as being something that's that's very supportive.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

31-10-2024,Why this analyst is 'not surprised' at Meta's post-earnings stock decline,Yahoo,"Meta Platforms (META) delivered strong third quarter results. The tech giant posted adjusted earnings of $6.03 per share, above the $5.25 Wall Street expected, and revenue of $40.59 billion, exceeding the projected $40.25 billion. Despite the quarterly beat, the stock experienced a post-earnings decline. Seaport Research Partners senior analyst Aaron Kessler joined Market Domination Overtime to explain this diverging market reaction. According to Kessler, market expectations for Meta were ""relatively high"" leading up to the earnings report. While the company beat street expectations, he notes that given the stock's strong performance before the announcement, he's ""not surprised to see it down a little bit."" Addressing Meta's AI strategy, Kessler identifies two key approaches: internal applications for automating advertising systems and operations and long-term initiatives to develop generative AI products and services. However, he characterizes the company's generative AI efforts as still being in their ""fairly early"" stages.

31-10-2024,Mag 7 earnings underline the group's huge market influence,Yahoo,"Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) delivered an earnings beat, sending the stock higher and fueling confidence in the “Magnificent Seven” group. With Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) set to report this week, Capital Fund Management head of macro strategy Christian Dery joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the impact of the Magnificent Seven on the broader market. “These companies have gotten so large that on earnings events…you're getting these swings in market cap on the order of $2 [billion] to $400 billion,” Dery says, highlighting Nvidia (NVDA) and its impact on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) specifically. The chipmaker doesn’t report earnings until Nov. 20. As the Magnificent Seven companies report earnings, capital spending will likely be closely watched by investors as Big Tech companies invest billions into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure without a definitive timeline on AI monetization. The strategist says, “The reality is that the existing incumbents have to build out this technology because they can't risk falling behind their competitors,” but “We haven't found the killer use case just yet, and the market is going to start to be more discerning in terms of [the] path to profitability scale. They're going to focus on CapEx and projections for CapEx.” For more on how Dery navigates investing in the Magnificent Seven, watch the video above.

Yet the stock has slipped as analysts grow concerned over whether Big Tech could have a new CapEx spending problem around AI. The tech giant reported revenue of $50.59 billion, surpassing the estimated $40.26 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) reached $6.03, beating analyst expectations of $5.52. Jefferies Senior Analyst Brent Thill joins Market Domination to provide insight into the results, noting that current tech sector pressure stems from broader market uncertainties rather than company performance. ""What we're seeing on our desk is not necessarily fear of Microsoft (MSFT) or Meta (META) massive miss but more a broader issue that's going on,"" Thill explains, highlighting upcoming events like next week's election and the Federal Reserve's November meeting as key concerns. Thill identifies AI capital expenditure as a ""central focus"" of the report. He points to favorable booking numbers compared to capital expenditure across Big Tech, explaining that ""that means more business is coming in than their spending."" While this allows companies to measure real revenue, he notes it's still ""early in the innings."" Roth Capital Partners managing director and senior research analyst Rohit Kulkarni told Yahoo Finance earlier today that this is a buy the dip opportunity for tech investors eyeing Meta stock. Regarding Meta specifically, Thill emphasizes AI's role in enhancing user experience by ""helping us as consumers find appropriate content, understand what's relevant,"" and personalizing commerce suggestions across Meta's platforms.

The analyst explains that while all the cloud hyperscalers are ramping up their capital spending to invest in AI, investors seem less concerned about Amazon’s AI spending compared to Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT). He says, “There's a few unique things” with Amazon,” including “Amazon's not solely reliant on chips from Nvidia” as “ they also build and create their own AI chips that are more cost-effective and of more value. So they may not be seeing the same type of capacity constraint issues that Microsoft is seeing at the moment.” Sundaram notes, “The other thing I would point out too is, you know, Amazon has multiple levers to grow margins,” including their e-commerce business, advertising, Amazon Web Services, and other segments.

It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.  Following a four-year investigation, South Korea’s Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022."

Despite the strong showings, capital expenditures (CapEx) on artificial intelligence (AI) are spooking some investors. Bernstein internet equity research analyst Mark Shmulik tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon ""feels like kind of the name that you can put money to work in and get excited about."" Alphabet also reported a positive third quarter, but Shmulik notes ongoing legal issues — especially in the antitrust arena — for Google that could hold the company back: ""There's just a whole bunch of noise around the name that's really hard to break through."" In terms of Meta, Shmulik also thinks the socail media giant is positioned well, but that when it comes to AI spending, ""we're still waiting to see just how big that spending is going to be and over what duration we could expect the return."" Shmulik goes on to explain his Underpeform rating on Reddit (RDDT). Watch the video above to hear Shmulik's take on big tech and other internet stocks.

It makes sense that the market isn't going to get enthusiastic about that,"" Ma tells the Morning Brief team. He notes, ""We do think 2025 is going to be a healthy year for earnings growth. We actually think that what's going to drive earnings growth in 2025 is business spending broadly. And part of that is certainly AI and what goes into it [like] data centers, upgrades to the electricity grid, other infrastructure that will drive spending, technology spending.""

06-11-2024,Amazon-Talen deal rejection is 'short-term setback' for Big Tech,Yahoo,"US regulators rejected a deal that would have allowed Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), to buy power from Talen Energy (TLN) for its data centers. The decision comes as Big Tech companies have turned to nuclear energy to power their artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, stoking some worries about the recent rally in nuclear energy stocks. ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. ""Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers. But the order may not represent a long-term risk. It's more that FERC may have punted or didn't want to set a precedent about co-location."" Fox outlines, ""Regulators are concerned about three things. They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy. Does the influx of new data centers create a concern about being able to meet state or local decarbonization policies?""

""It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,"" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of ""hold[ing] a grudge"" or being ""very vindictive."" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they ""stand to gain"" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains ""so uncertain"" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.

Precision Neuroscience is developing its version of an implanted brain-computer interface (BCI) technology meant to help individuals with neurological disorders, such as ALS, to better function and communicate. Mager says Precision Neuroscience's technology is high-bandwidth, sits on ""the surface of the brain without doing any damage,"" and is reversible.  In an interview with Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Yasmin Khorram from the Yahoo Invest conference, Mager discusses the company's road ahead and potential market, what to expect from the upcoming Trump presidency, and a possible IPO. “We view brain computer interfaces as a generationally important life sciences innovation,” says Mager. “This is gonna have applicability today in paralysis, tomorrow in a number of different areas.” To see every interview from Yahoo Finance Invest, click here.

Kerwin believes these companies may seek to diversify their trade relationships to regions like India or Southeast Asia, stating ""it will be a trend across the sector.""

On the other hand, Adobe (ADBE) is one he has worries about.

Roth Capital Partners managing director and senior research analyst Rohit Kulkarni tells Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills that other social media platforms would naturally benefit from the elimination of TikTok, which says it has 170 million monthly active US users. “I would expect shares in Snap (SNAP) to rise the most and then shares in Meta (META) to rise as well. But having said that, what happens in January and what happens to TikTok stands as far as appeals and the next steps in the legal process, that remains to be seen,” Kulkarni says. “That's what further complicates the scenarios, and whether Trump and [Elon] Musk together, how they work with TikTok in the future.” Musk is the owner of X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. In addition to the new administration set to take power in January, ByteDance is expected to appeal this decision, which could head all the way to the Supreme Court. “In my opinion, there is a scenario that TikTok would still be around come [February 1], working alive and well in the US So there is a that could again reverse some of the gains in the social media stocks that we might see when it comes to just this back and forth and uncertainty,” Kulkarni says.

""It's certainly something we keep an eye on, but I would say that if you had been worried about that concentration or used it as a reason to get out of the market at any point over the last couple of years, it would have been a mistake,"" Mayfield says. The strategist believes investors ""should be celebrating that some of the biggest and most innovative companies are in our markets. Concentration risk, or heavy concentration, has not been a good forward indicator over the last 40 or 50 years based on the data that we've seen.""

O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

She notes the popular social media app's 200% year-over-year growth in traffic. ""It captures your attention with the content and the algorithm, and through personalization, it drives you through the funnel to get you to convert,"" Tipograph says. ""So it's the power of the entire marketing funnel that exists within TikTok. You find some of that in Meta, you find some of that in Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) but TikTok is the whole story."" Tipograph notes if the Chinese-owned app is banned, Alphabet could see the biggest gains in ad revenue, while e-commerce platforms like Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), and Walmart (WMT) could benefit from TikTok Shops' potential loss.

This leadership group, which had largely underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, has seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, tech mega-caps like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL (GOOGL)) significantly exceeded earnings estimates. Barclays' data indicates that these large-cap tech companies beat analyst earnings estimates by an average of 8% in the first quarter. Second, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was once again impressive. Goldman Sachs' (GS) data reveals that large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieved an average earnings growth of 28% in the first quarter, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500.

Digital turnarounds take time, and are not guaranteed in a world where Google (GOOGL, GOOG) is dropping AI summaries on the web, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to attract top AI talent, and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) is upending how the very internet works. Still, many digital founders hope for the best when trying to bring a meandering platform back to life. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi discusses the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Nextdoor (KIND) co-founder and CEO Nirav Tolia. Tolia co-founded Nextdoor in 2008 and led the company until 2018, when he reportedly left over a board disagreement regarding an acquisition. He returned to the company as CEO in May 2024, finding a social media platform struggling to grow, a weak product, and a sliding market cap. Tolia has since aimed to refocus the organization on the user experience, with initial signs of success in increasing weekly average users. But he concedes the turnaround has a long way to go, and investors are unsure what a complete turnaround will look like. Nextdoor’s market cap has dwindled from $4.3 billion during its SPAC IPO in 2021 to $636 million. Tolia dives deep into his turnaround strategy for Nextdoor, the decision to return as CEO, and what’s next for the digital platform.

We have American buyers. And I haven't spoken to President Xi about it. At the right time, when we're set, I'll do it. In the meantime, until the complexity of things work out, we just extend a little bit longer."" If TikTok’s U.S. business is sold, it’s expected to be owned by a joint venture featuring American investors, while ByteDance retains a minority stake.Now the share buyback could help to bolster morale for the firm’s U.S. employees, who have been anxious over its future in the country.TikTok has reportedly been working on a standalone app for users there, but it remains unclear how its status in the U.S. will be resolved."

24-10-2024,Compounded GLP-1s are a 'symptom' of supply shortage: Ro CEO,Yahoo,"Competition in the GLP-1 market is intensifying as new players pour into the weight-loss drug landscape. Industry leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are already struggling to meet soaring demand, facing significant shortages of their weight loss and diabetes medications. Now, these pharmaceutical giants face additional competition from companies producing compounded versions of these drugs. Ro Co-Founder and CEO Zach Reitano tells Market Domination he is ""rooting for the [GLP-1] shortage to end"" as this would improve patient access to needed medications. ""It's really important for people to understand, when it comes to these branded medications, there are tens of millions of people who are covered,"" he explains, noting that while many patients have access through insurance with a $50 median copay, others face more limited options. For these patients, Reitano stresses that ""compounding is their only option right now,"" whether due to ongoing shortages or affordability concerns. ""For us, it's not a free win that compounding is permitted. It's also been a very important part of the healthcare system for a long time. It's a sign that right now supply is not able to meet demand, so I think it's more of a symptom than it is a win,"" Reitano states, acknowledging that the need for compounding reflects broader challenges in pharmaceutical accessibility. The drug distributor runs its own GLP-1 Insurance Coverage Checker, an online tool that enables patients to check whether potential GLP-1 treatment is covered under their insurance plans.  To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

But Okupe says it's not a concern right now, but acknowledges the shortages will come to an end.""In our view, we do still see that the medications are on on shortage. And what we do see on our platform. And this is the benefit of being a consumer oriented platform, is that we hear feedback directly from consumers and what consumers are telling us, you know resoundingly, is that they are struggling to get access to name-brand GLP-1 medications over the last two months,"" according to Okupe.

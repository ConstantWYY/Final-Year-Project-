However, he highlights ""a lot of bad news"" for the stock in the fourth quarter, from seasonality pressures to the presidential election: ""I don't think the risk-reward here is attractive."" Ahluwalia adds that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, by endorsing former President Donald Trump, is now linking Tesla to the fortunes of the Trump campaign, which will have an impact on Tesla stock.

""It has been trading on hopes and dreams, and now investors want a show-me stock,"" Woods explains, suggesting that companies like Netflix (NFLX) or Eli Lilly (LLY) would be better suited for the Magnificent Seven. Regarding today's upcoming earnings report, Woods characterizes the potential market reaction as a ""coin flip."" ""It's one to watch.

The EV maker stated it is on track for ""slight growth"" in EV deliveries for 2024, while projecting production on affordable EVs to begin in 2025. ""This just confirms what they've been saying, which is we're going to get affordable cars in the first half of next year,"" RBC Capital Markets Global Autos Analyst Tom Narayan tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton, adding: ""We all thought we were going to see something at the robotaxi event about this, but I think folks are just comforted to know that it is coming. Everything is on track on the more affordable cars."" Narayan discusses Tesla's earnings print and what it is forecasting about the electric automaker's margins: ""They did do some discounting and they're going to try to get that growth number for the full year. So Q4 you're going to see some price-cutting. But if they can still do a 17% margin, X credits, that's a pretty strong signal that... they can continue to hold on to margins."" Tesla reported 462,890 EV deliveries, just below Wall Street consensus estimates 463,897. Narayan believes Tesla's Full Self-Driving upgrades and pivots to autonomous driving could be boosting its demand. ""The services number was pretty high. So I do wonder if the services attach rate, especially FSD, might be making making an impact here. Folks could be thinking I'm going to buy this car because of FSD,"" Narayan says. ""That may be catalyzing demand. And kind of even though the models are maybe a little long in the tooth... FSD is something, something special here that might be what's happening.""

The rideshare platform posted revenue of $11.19 billion, surpassing estimates of $10.99 billion. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.20, significantly higher than the anticipated $0.45. Despite these positive metrics, Uber's stock faced pressure due to weaker-than-expected gross bookings and a reduced fourth quarter outlook. Kindred Ventures Founder and managing partner Steve Jang joins Morning Brief to provide insights into Uber's performance and future potential. ""The company is starting to show that it's not just a marketplace company but a software company,"" Jang says, highlighting Uber's profitability and continued growth opportunities. Jang emphasizes Uber's strategic positioning, pointing to potential expansion in autonomous and electric vehicles. He praises the company's cost-consciousness and ability to apply its software network across ridesharing, delivery, and freight services. ""Uber is the demand network,"" Jang states, arguing that emerging technologies like Waymo and Tesla's (TSLA) autonomous vehicles will take time to impact the market. However, Uber's global network, software, and 24/7 operations provide a competitive advantage that these companies may want to use in the future.

Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder and Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton sits down with Josh Lipton on Market Domination Overtime to discuss what the election outcome means for Musk and how his political involvement affects investors. ""It will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk,"" Clinton says, adding, ""He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction. And I think if it goes against him if Kamala Harris is elected president, I think it probably is a negative for him."" He notes that Tesla could stand to benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a green energy push. Clinton says that Musk will likely ""find some way to try to mend fences and say, 'Look, obviously, it didn't go the way that we were campaigning, but we have this agenda that actually does very much align with some of the principles of the Democratic Party.' I mean, Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world."" As an investor in Musk's companies, Clinton says, ""We try to separate [Musk's companies from his politics]. At Deepwater, we are investors in xAI, and we're big believers that there's basically four companies on Earth that have a chance to build the foundation models that power sort of everything. It's Meta (META) with Llama, it's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) [with] Gemini, OpenAI with GPT, and then xAI with Grok. So that investment is really built, I think, more on just what can they do from a technical perspective.""

While CEO Elon Musk was a vocal supporter of Trump, the President-elect has not expressed the same enthusiasm for the electric vehicle industry. ""It's interesting because there's a lot of government help or regulation or incentive all pushing the electric vehicle transition, and Tesla's absolutely benefited from that. But we also know that Donald Trump doesn't necessarily support that thinking,"" iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer told Yahoo Finance. Brauer notes that a ""government-led transition to EVs"" is not a concept that Trump has embraced. He points to the broader EV market beyond Tesla, noting that other stocks in the sector are not experiencing the same rally as Tesla. ""It's interesting to see that people feel like Elon's relationship with Donald Trump will overcome a potential shift in policy,"" he adds. Moving forward, Brauer believes that Trump's policy regarding EVs may hurt the sector, including Tesla.

2024/11/8,Trump prepares Cabinet picks amid uncertain House control,Yahoo,"With former President Donald Trump's election victory, he will now begin the process of transitioning back into the White House and selecting members for his Cabinet. This comes as politicians and observers await the final determination of whether the Democrats or Republicans will gain control of the House of Representatives. Bipartisan Policy Center executive director of economic policy Shai Akabas and The Washington Note founding editor-at-large Steve Clemons provide insights into the potential makeup of Trump's incoming administration on Wealth! Clemons notes that multiple individuals are being considered for key Cabinet positions, including names like Mike Pompeo, Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton, and Josh Hawley. However, Clemons does not foresee Elon Musk being appointed to a formal Cabinet role despite being a major influence throughout Trump's campaign period. ""I think Elon is in a complicated position. For him to get a Senate-confirmed position, I think he'd have to pretty much divest himself from a lot of his assets that define him, like SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA)."" Instead, Clemons believes Musk may be offered an advisory role. One of the initiatives Musk has reportedly advocated for is cutting federal spending by up to $2 trillion. Akabas calls this an ""admirable goal,"" but notes the challenge lies in the fact that much of the government's spending is on ""autopilot"" through programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the national debt. Akabas explains that the potential areas for cuts represent only around 15% of the overall federal budget. ""Even if you eliminated that entire part of the federal spending, which encompasses most government agencies, you would not solve our fiscal challenges that we have today,"" he states.

2024/11/9,Elon Musk will be 'vitally important' in Trump admin: Cathie Wood,Yahoo,"M&A could be back on the menu for companies looking forward to a second Donald Trump presidency ??major banks anticipate a slew of beneficial deregulations while Big Tech believes it has found a new friend in its antitrust battles with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). To expand more upon how Corporate America is interpreting Trump's 2024 election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, ARK Investment Management CEO and CIO Cathie Wood sits down with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination Overtime. Wood's firm manages the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which has a variety of holdings in tech players like Tesla (TSLA), Palantir Technologies (PLTR), and Coinbase Global (COIN). Wood calls Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler ""a menace"" to crypto-adoption in the US, and says replacing FTC Chair Lina Khan will ""break the M&A logjam"" for most companies. ""I think venture capital has been harmed dramatically in the last few years, for lack of liquidity events. Liquidity events, very importantly, involve mergers and acquisitions, and those ground to a halt, even in mergers or deals where the two companies were not competing with each other,"" Wood tells Yahoo Finance. A long-time supporter of Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Wood believes he will play a ""vitally important role"" in Trump's government efficiency initiative while remaining ""focused"" on the plethora of companies he owns. ""As he says, and I've always believed, government spending is taxation, and we are bloated right now. We're just overwhelmed with taxation as well,"" Wood explains. ""So I think that he's going to be really important in two ways ??introducing new technologies, and actually cutting out a lot of middlemen in the government, just like he did at Twitter."" Tesla currently makes up 14.21% of the ARK Innovation ETF, the holdings worth just over $900 million. Wood is forecasting Tesla stock to reach $2,600 in five years time; while confident in the EV maker's ability to bring safe fully autonomous vehicles to market, she disagrees that Tesla's most recent stock jump has to do with Musk's affiliation with Trump.

Wedbush managing director and senior equity research analyst Dan Ives joins Asking for a Trend to discuss potential impacts on Tesla and the broader tech sector. ""It's a new era with Trump because ultimately, if you look now, autonomous is going to get fast-tracked in our opinion, and that is significant because of Tesla and the AI future,"" he tells Yahoo Finance, describing Musk's strategic backing of Trump a ""poker move for the ages."" Ives outlines three key potential impacts that could benefit: changes to EV tax credits could give Tesla advantages in price, scale, and scope, the Cybercab project ""could get accelerated by years,"" and current regulatory issues ""essentially now go away."" ""Musk is going to be a whisper in the White House, and that is something the market is factoring in,"" Ives states, describing it as ""a Goldilocks scenario for any tech investor.""

""It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,"" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of ""hold[ing] a grudge"" or being ""very vindictive."" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they ""stand to gain"" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains ""so uncertain"" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.

Steyer explains how pulling back from a position as a global leader in the energy transition could be detrimental to the US's competition with China: ""If we're not pushing on this from an economic and business standpoint, that means China is pushing on it from an economic and business standpoint.""

Matt Kohrs, YouTuber and ""The Matt Kohrs Show"" host, tells Wealth! host Brad Smith that he sees two paths ahead for bitcoin: ""It's either the best store of value ever created, or we're looking at another tulip mania that is maybe on the precipice of popping."" Kohrs is positive on bitcoin, citing its performance against the U.S. dollar. ""Now, in the short term, your guess is as good as mine. We might as well just be flipping a coin. But in the long term, if this idea of a store of value and the US dollar always being devalued, I think bitcoin goes higher and higher."" When it comes to the next major milestone for bitcoin, Kohrs says, ""I think the next big psychological level in terms of US dollar value will be 250,000, which I want to make clear, I do believe is very possible in the upcoming calendar year."" He's less positive when analyzing the fundamentals of GameStop (GME) and other so-called ""meme stocks."" Kohrs says, ""When I look at the entire investable universe, GameStop's not really a top tier one because we don't have much forward direction from the company and the company's leadership at this moment in time."" Instead, he suggests these retail investors have more to gain from companies with stronger fundamentals, including Tesla (TSLA) and Palantir (PLTR).

For consumers, he explains, ""It really came down to high vehicle prices and interest rates at multi-decade highs, really kind of increas[ing] those multi-payments for consumers, and that led to kind of trickle-down effects for the greater industry."" Regarding the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on the US auto industry, Roberts notes that ""much is uncertain right now."" He emphasizes that the fallout would highly depend on when the tariffs go into effect and which countries are impacted. ""I think if there's forewarning, the auto industry is very adaptable and can move around and kind of reallocate resources,"" Roberts says. ""But if it goes into immediate effect, that's where it would be a little bit more disruptive for the industry."" Regarding the incoming Trump administration's considerations to remove EV tax credits, he notes that they currently help support affordability for both new and used electric vehicles, and if removed, it could represent ""a headwind for the industry in 2025.""

He describes this as ""the future of Tesla,"" which will ""unleash"" an enormous market opportunity for the company. However, Nelson forecasts that the electric vehicle maker will fall short of its 2025 sales targets. He tells Yahoo Finance: ""If they continue to make progress towards getting approval for fully autonomous vehicles, that's really what's going to matter more, and we think investors will be forgiving if they fall short of that guidance.""

While the narrow leadership has raised some concerns about concentration and broadening trading themes, Baird Investment strategist Ross Mayfield tells Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Morning Brief that these worries may be overblown. ""It's certainly something we keep an eye on, but I would say that if you had been worried about that concentration or used it as a reason to get out of the market at any point over the last couple of years, it would have been a mistake,"" Mayfield says. The strategist believes investors ""should be celebrating that some of the biggest and most innovative companies are in our markets. Concentration risk, or heavy concentration, has not been a good forward indicator over the last 40 or 50 years based on the data that we've seen."" ""It's something to keep an eye on [as] it maybe makes the market a little bit more fragile to something like Nvidia having a bad stretch run, but it's not something that we worry about too much,"" Mayfield adds.

According to Fish, Nike's primary challenge centers on its regional sales performance. While the company maintains a ""relatively high"" supply chain presence, it faces mounting pressure from local competitors ""that are trying to displace Nike"" as Chinese officials aim to reduce foreign brands' dominance in its market. Fish emphasizes that ""retailers and manufacturers need to make a decision about how much they're going to focus on China,"" citing weakening consumer demand and ongoing US-China tensions as key factors. Regarding Tesla's position in China, Fish observes that ""Tesla's future in China is so tied to Trump's relationship with Musk"" and how long that lasts. He highlights additional concerns about Tesla's data collection capabilities in China, noting that ""there's a lot of concern that Teslas can drive into [or near] a military installation... and they're [China] a lot more paranoid about that than the Europeans or the Americans are on data protection.""

2025/1/3,Tesla's Q4 delivery miss suggests 'investor fatigue': Analyst,Yahoo,"Tesla (TSLA) reported fourth quarter deliveries of 495,570, falling short of Wall Street expectations and marking its first decline in annual deliveries in nearly a decade. William Blair Group head of energy and sustainability research Jed Dorsheimer joins Market Domination to analyze the company's figures. Dorsheimer observes ""investor fatigue"" surrounding Tesla's latest offerings, including the Cybertruck and Models S and X. He notes that, while the Cybertruck's price is set to decrease, it remains ""a very niche market"" for that vehicle type, suggesting a limited impact on overall deliveries. He emphasizes that Tesla's success primarily stems from its more affordable offerings: the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. ""For Tesla to rebound from a volume perspective on the auto side of its business, we think it's really going to be the introduction of a Model 2 or hatchback,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.? Dorsheimer highlights ""a silver lining"" in Tesla's energy storage side and concludes, ""Tesla has a lot of different tools in its toolbox, and we'll see how it plays out.

On the other hand, Tesla (TSLA) saw a decline in its annual EV sales for the first time in over a decade. RBC Capital Markets Global Autos Analyst Tom Narayan joins the Morning Brief team to weigh in on the two electric automakers' recent performances. ""I think it's both of those may be overanalyzed a little too much,"" Narayan tells Brad Smith and Madison Mills. ""For the Rivian one, we knew the company told us that Q4 was going to be stronger than Q3, they had a supply issue in Q3. The Q4 delivery number was actually consistent with their guidance."" Narayan explains that while Tesla came out below consensus estimates, its EV delivery results were ""still a solid number,"" noting the company to have gotten a boost this past quarter amid conversations around the future of its full self-driving (FSD) capabilities.

2025/1/7,Tesla's stock valuation appears 'discounted': Analyst explains,Yahoo,"President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariff policy has raised investor concerns about its potential impact on industries, including electric vehicles (EVs), particularly for companies like Tesla (TSLA). Stifel NextGen transport analyst Stephen Gengaro joins Market Domination to share his perspective on the EV maker amid tariff uncertainties. Gengaro suggests that Trump's proposed tariff policy would have ""wide-ranging"" effects, including reduced competition in US markets ??a development that could be ""theoretically a positive"" for Tesla. However, he cautions that the company may face challenges with its international supply chain for parts sourced outside the US. The analyst emphasizes that Tesla is ""more than a car company,"" pointing to initiatives like full self-driving (FSD) technology as ""a huge value driver"" for the stock in the ""medium-to-long term."" He suggests that the potential of these ventures makes the current stock valuation appear ""discounted."" Looking ahead to the Trump administration, Gengaro anticipates more favorable regulations that could accelerate Tesla's initiatives. ""As far as Musk betting on Trump, I think he's clearly engaged in the conversation as far as getting regulation accelerated on the FSD side,"" he explains. ""And that sort of opens the door for just various growth opportunities for the company over time.""

Tigay notes that Tesla is a leader in the world of electric vehicles (EVs) and is likely to receive favorable treatment from the new presidential administration. This may be bolstered by the fact that reduced EV spending overall is anticipated under Trump 2.0, positioning Tesla to be the winner of the sector. Beyond Tesla's EVs, Tigay highlights the company's battery sector as a promising revenue stream in the future. ""I think that's going to be a big player going forward in the next four years,"" he says. , among other signs that Bezos has been fostering an amicable relationship with the president-elect. These moves note a shift from the historical feud between Bezos and Trump.Amazon is another one of Tigay's top picks, partly due to Jeff Bezos' recent financial support of Trumphttps://finance.yahoo.com... ""It seems like Amazon, this time around, is attempting to be on more favorable conditions,"" Tigay explains. ""In general, Amazon wants to have a favorable relationship with this administration because there's big money to be had, specifically in the cloud services.""

This leadership group, which had largely underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, has seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, tech mega-caps like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL (GOOGL)) significantly exceeded earnings estimates. Barclays' data indicates that these large-cap tech companies beat analyst earnings estimates by an average of 8% in the first quarter. Second, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was once again impressive. Goldman Sachs' (GS) data reveals that large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieved an average earnings growth of 28% in the first quarter, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500.

2025/7/24,Tesla faces 'a few rough quarters' from end of US EV support: Musk,Yahoo,"STORY: Tesla's in for a ""few rough quarters"", says its CEO Elon Musk, citing U.S. government cuts in support for electric vehicle makers.That's as Tesla posted its worst quarterly sales decline in over a decade Wednesday.Overall revenue fell 12%, despite the launch of a refreshed version of Tesla's best-selling Model Y SUV - which investors had hoped would boost sales.Revenue and profit were?also hurt by a?51% dive in sales of regulatory credits.Those credits are bought from Tesla by other automakers who have difficulty complying with government emissions rules.The U.S. government later this year is cutting tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV buyers.:: FileWhen asked on a quarterly results conference call about the credits, Musk predicted ""a few rough quarters"" before a wave of revenue from self-driving software and services begins late next year.Tesla shares fell nearly 5% after his comments.In the meantime, Tesla says it is working on a new, cheaper car - with a few initial units made by the end of June.But production would ramp up next quarter, slower than initially expected.The company also said it continued to expect volume production of its custom-built robotaxi - called the Cybercab - and Semi Truck in 2026.Much of the company's trillion-dollar valuation hangs on its bet on humanoid robots and?on its robotaxi service.But one analyst - CEO of Systematic Ventures Max Wolff - was skeptical of its chances to turn fortunes.""The problem is there's other guys who have done more rides with less issues in a Robotaxi, particularly Waymo. This is sort of a major competitor here who's been at this longer, done many more rides and seems to have had a smoother integration.

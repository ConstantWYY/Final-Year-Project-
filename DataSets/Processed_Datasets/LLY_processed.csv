2024-10-24,Compounded GLP-1s are a 'symptom' of supply shortage: Ro CEO,Yahoo,"Competition in the GLP-1 market is intensifying as new players pour into the weight-loss drug landscape. Industry leaders Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are already struggling to meet soaring demand, facing significant shortages of their weight loss and diabetes medications. Now, these pharmaceutical giants face additional competition from companies producing compounded versions of these drugs. Ro Co-Founder and CEO Zach Reitano tells Market Domination he is ""rooting for the [GLP-1] shortage to end"" as this would improve patient access to needed medications. ""It's really important for people to understand, when it comes to these branded medications, there are tens of millions of people who are covered,"" he explains, noting that while many patients have access through insurance with a $50 median copay, others face more limited options. For these patients, Reitano stresses that ""compounding is their only option right now,"" whether due to ongoing shortages or affordability concerns. ""For us, it's not a free win that compounding is permitted. It's also been a very important part of the healthcare system for a long time. It's a sign that right now supply is not able to meet demand, so I think it's more of a symptom than it is a win,"" Reitano states, acknowledging that the need for compounding reflects broader challenges in pharmaceutical accessibility. The drug distributor runs its own GLP-1 Insurance Coverage Checker, an online tool that enables patients to check whether potential GLP-1 treatment is covered under their insurance plans.  To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

""Additionally, at the end of the quarter, we also saw 2 million consumers on the platform, of which 1 million were benefiting from a personalized solution. And so really, the strong results that we're seeing in the third quarter are a reflection of us executing across the strategy that we've held for the past couple of years."" Okupe also addresses a possible headwind for the company, that Eli Lilly (LLY)'s and Novo Nordisk (NVO)'s weight-loss drugs are coming off the FDA's (Food and Drug Administration) shortage lists. But Okupe says it's not a concern right now, but acknowledges the shortages will come to an end.""In our view, we do still see that the medications are on on shortage. And what we do see on our platform. And this is the benefit of being a consumer oriented platform, is that we hear feedback directly from consumers and what consumers are telling us, you know resoundingly, is that they are struggling to get access to name-brand GLP-1 medications over the last two months,"" according to Okupe.

When they are finished, I don't think they will have them empty. I think they will have people inside to produce, so they can sell what they are doing in the world.”Novo Nordisk employs around 5,500 people in this town of 16,500."
